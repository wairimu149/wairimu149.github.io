  Using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on key factors like area, bedrooms, and age — blending statistical modeling with real-world insights.
---

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a **Linear Regression model** in Python to predict home prices using factors such as house area, number of bedrooms, and property age. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data exploration, cleaning, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Highlights
- Explored the dataset using **Pandas** and handled missing values effectively.  
- Built a predictive model using **Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression**.  
- Evaluated performance with **MAE**, **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R² Score**.  
- Visualized the regression line and compared predictions with actual prices.  
- Predicted the price of a new house based on a given area size.
