  A Tableau dashboard exploring the used car market: price trends, supply vs demand, and key factors driving value.
---

## Project Overview  
I developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to explore the used car market dynamics. This project enables stakeholders to understand pricing trends, demand and supply patterns, condition vs value relationships, and other market drivers.

## Objectives  
- Analyze pricing trends across different car makes, models, ages, and regions.  
- Examine supply and demand dynamics and how they affect market value.  
- Explore the relationship between car condition, mileage, age, and resale value.  
- Provide actionable insights to stakeholders (buyers, sellers, or analysts) aiming for data-driven decisions in the used car market.

---

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Tableau Public** for the interactive dashboard and visual storytelling.  
- Datasets pre-processed using Excel / CSV or Python (specify if you used Python for cleaning).  
- Key metrics include average resale price by age, mileage bands, condition ratings, regional supply/demand ratios, and value depreciation curves.  
- Visualization best practices: clear segmentation, dynamic filters, interactive charts and maps (if applicable).

## Key Insights  
- Resale values decline sharply for cars older than ~5 years or with mileage beyond a critical threshold, showing non-linear depreciation.  
- Certain models and makes retain value better due to brand, reliability, or parts availability.  
- Regions with tighter supply show higher average prices, indicating geographic demand impacts.  
- Cars in better condition (fewer previous owners, service history) typically command higher prices even after controlling for age and mileage.  
- Demand surges in specific regions or model types (e.g., compact SUVs) shift market value upward ahead of supply catching up.

## Reflection & Next Steps  
Creating this dashboard emphasized the importance of combining domain understanding (used car market) with strong analysis and visualization techniques. Going forward I plan to:  
- Integrate predictive modelling (e.g., forecast resale price based on age, mileage, condition, model).  
- Expand datasets to include features like fuel type, engine size, ownership history, and service records for richer insights.  
- Add scenario-planning filters (e.g., ‚Äúwhat if mileage reduces by 10 %‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if region supply increases by 20 %‚Äù) to support strategy for buyers or sellers.
