## Project Overview  
This project involves visualizing pharmaceutical sales data using Tableau. The dashboard includes:  
- **Total sales by medicine** (bar chart)  
- **Quantity sold over time** (line chart)  
- **Pharmacy location Ã— medicine performance** (heatmap)  
- **Revenue contribution by medicine** (pie chart)  

The insights help identify **top-selling medicines, peak demand periods, and pharmacy performance**, providing guidance for stock planning and marketing strategies.

## Objectives  
- Load and clean the pharmaceutical sales dataset.  
- Ensure `Medicine`, `PharmacyLocation`, and `Date` fields are valid and consistent.  
- Create calculated fields such as `TotalRevenue = Quantity * PricePerUnit`.  
- Visualize key metrics using bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, and pie charts.  
- Identify actionable insights for medicine stocking, pharmacy performance, and revenue optimization.
