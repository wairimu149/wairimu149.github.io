## Project Overview  
In this project, I performed a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to identify factors influencing passenger survival.

## Objectives  
- Explore passenger attributes such as age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation point to assess their impact on survival.  
- Visualize key relationships and uncover hidden patterns in the dataset.  
- Provide actionable insights that enhance understanding of the dataset and inform predictive modelling strategies.

---

## Tools & Techniques  
- **Python** with pandas and NumPy for data wrangling.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.  
- Emphasis on clean data handling: missing values, feature engineering, and correlation analysis.

---

## Key Insights  
- Survival rate was significantly higher for females and children.  
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a better chance of survival compared to lower classes.  
- Fare and age had meaningful relationships with survival â€” younger passengers and higher fare paid tended toward better outcomes.  
- Embarkation point and family size also played noticeable roles in survival probability.

## Reflection & Next Steps  
Working through this EDA deepened my understanding of feature relationships and storytelling through visuals. Next, I plan to:  
- Extend the analysis to build predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, tree-based models).  
- Introduce additional feature engineering (such as titles, family size categories) for better insight.  
- Explore model performance and validation to transition from analysis to actionable predictions.
