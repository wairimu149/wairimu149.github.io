## Project Overview
In this project, I developed an interactive HR summary dashboard using Tableau to help HR teams and business leaders gain visibility into workforce trends, performance, and opportunities for improvement.

## Objectives
- Provide a consolidated view of headcount, tenure, turnover, and hiring.  
- Highlight department-level patterns and performance metrics.  
- Enable stakeholders to explore HR data visually and make data-driven decisions.

---

## Tools & Techniques
- **Tableau Public** ‚Äî interactive dashboard and visual storytelling.  
- **Excel / CSV** for preprocessing and cleaning.  
- KPIs used: turnover rate, average tenure, new hires, department headcount.  
- Applied visualization best practices (clear layout, readable labels, interactive filters).

---

## Key Insights
- Departments with higher turnover tended to have lower average tenure ‚Äî a potential retention concern.  
- Hiring spikes in certain quarters suggest seasonal recruitment or project ramp-ups.  
- Role and tenure distributions reveal areas with high experience concentration versus those needing development.  
- Interactive filters enable drilling down by department, role, or period for targeted insights.

## Reflection & Next Steps
Building this dashboard reinforced my ability to structure visual stories that stakeholders can navigate intuitively. For future improvements I would:
- Add predictive analytics (e.g., turnover forecasting) for forward-looking insights.  
- Integrate employee engagement and training data for fuller context.  
- Add scenario-based filters (e.g., ‚Äúwhat if hiring increases by 20%‚Äù) to support planning.
