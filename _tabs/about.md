    I’m a data-driven professional with a background in Mathematics, Statistics, and finance. 
    Passionate about transforming raw data into real results and uncovering insights that drive smarter business decisions. 
    My key areas include data analysis, visualization, and reporting — with strong skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel. 
    I’m curious, analytical, and impact-oriented, driven by continuous learning, problem-solving, and creating value through data. 
    Driven by data, defined by impact.
